### a small set of `scikit-learn` sklearn.Transformers (har har) to make constructing feature sklearn.Pipelines out of heterogenous pd.DataFrames 'easier' (less FeatureUnions out of nested Pipelines, and accessible at a higher hierarchy for GridSearch and such)
### tldr; objs you can plug into a sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline that can take a whole DataFrame and only transform certain things at each step
